# Foolproof web engineer technical exercise

The purpose of the exercise is to create a basic website that displays some data it receives from a mock API.

A basic app has been setup for you in `index.html`.

A mock API has been created for you. You will need to call the `getData` function and display the received data in the markup available. Feel free to rearrange the sample markup (eg`<table>` element or anything else) to display the data how you like it.

You are free to use additional tools and libraries (eg jQuery) as you see fit. We would like to see symantically correct markup and some CSS styling would be good to have. Bonus points for responsive layouts. The `index.html` is a starting point, feel free to discard and start fresh if you have a particular approach in mind!

## How to return the submission

Once your solution is complete either submit it as a git repository or a zip file.

Thank you, we look forward to seeing your creation.
